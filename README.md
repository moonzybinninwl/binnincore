# binnincore

**binnincore** is an ultra-skidded Roblox internal exploit developed during my early learning phase of C++.  
It supports approximately **80% of UNC functions** and is classified as a **Level 8 internal**.  
This project is more of a proof-of-concept and learning resource than a polished exploit.

## About the Project

binnincore started as a personal project while I was learning C++ and reverse engineering Roblox internals.  
The codebase is heavily adapted ("skidded") from various sources, so it’s not optimized or fully secure and like has a shit ton of vulns.  
Despite this, it offers solid partial unc coverage and a foundation for further development or educational purposes.

### Key Characteristics:
- ~80% UNC support — i honestly can't remember what the unc was lmao so this is an estiamte
- Level 8 identity.
- Ultra-skidded code from my C++ learning days, making it an okay starting point for learning and experimentation  
- Minimal external dependencies

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Open the project in your preferred C++ IDE (Visual Studio recommended).  
3. Update the include directories if necessary — typically you shouldn’t have to change much if your environment is set up.  
4. Build the DLL targeting your environment (x64 or x86 depending on Roblox version).  
5. Inject the compiled DLL into the Roblox client process using your injector.  
6. Explore and test the supported UNC functions.
